### *Hold the evidence to the light. Watch the verdict refract.*

**QuorumForge** takes the recorded deliberation of a council of agents — who
supported what, who pushed back, how sure they were, and what they cited — and
passes it through a prism of weighted reasoning. Out the far side come four
clean bands of light: **consensus**, **split**, **contested**, and
**unsupported**. Deterministic. Auditable. Re-derivable by hand.

## The one-paragraph pitch

A council argues. Somebody has to write down what the argument *concluded*.
QuorumForge is that scribe — and, more importantly, that *judge*. It is **not an
agent orchestrator**: it does not run agents, call models, or manage prompts. It
operates purely on the *record* of a deliberation after the debate is over. That
separation is the whole point. Because the engine only reads a static transcript
of positions, its judgements are reproducible: the same evidence file always
yields the same verdict, the same report bytes, and the same integrity digest.
You can commit a verdict to version control and diff it next week.

## Why a prism?

White light looks like a single, undifferentiated thing until a prism teases it
apart. A pile of agent opinions is the same: it *feels* like noise until you
separate it by direction and strength. QuorumForge's prism has exactly four
exit angles, and every claim leaves through exactly one of them.

| Band | Glyph | What it means |
|------|:-----:|---------------|
| **Consensus**   | ◆ | Strong agreement with little dissent. Affirmed or negated. |
| **Split**       | ◈ | A real lean, but below the consensus bar. Not yet settled. |
| **Contested**   | ▲ | Meaningful weight on *both* sides. The council is divided. |
| **Unsupported** | ○ | Too little decisive weight to conclude anything at all. |

The "unsupported" band is not a failure mode — it is a finding. Knowing that a
claim has *no* backing is often as valuable as knowing it is true.
