## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-31

The first release. QuorumForge arrives as a complete, dependency-free evidence
adjudication engine with a matching council viewer.

### Added

- **Rust core (std-only).**
  - Data model for agents, claims, positions, citations, and deliberations.
  - Two input parsers that converge on one model: a line-oriented `.qf` format
    (comments, escapes, `cite` attachment) and a JSON format.
  - A compact, idempotent JSON codec — parser and writer — with insertion-order
    preservation, unicode escape and surrogate-pair handling, and six-decimal
    number snapping for byte-stable output.
  - Lexical claim normalization: whitespace collapse, trailing-punctuation
